## Introduction

InternHub is a web application that automatically aggregates information about internships so students can have an easier time finding the internships of their dreams. InternHub allows users to keep track of the internships they've applied to, see how many people have applied to internships at a specific company, 
and easily filter internships to find ones that fit their desires.
